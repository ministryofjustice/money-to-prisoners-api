    It ensures that the user is authenticated, and has the appropriate
    `add`/`change`/`delete` permissions on the model.

    This permission can only be applied against view classes that
    provide a `.queryset` attribute.

    Permission mapping is defined against view actions ('list', 'retrieve',
    'update', 'destroy' etc.).
    When using custom actions on a view, you would have to add a new
    (key, value) to the mapping and set the permissions you want the class
    to test against.

    This version is slightly better than the
    `rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissions` one in our use case
    as it's based on actions instead of methods.
    A `POST` that creates a resource and one that makes an action on a resource
    usually have different permissions so they should be treated differently.

    NOTE: This is only meant to work with ViewSets.
